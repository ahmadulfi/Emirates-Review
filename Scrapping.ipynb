      "[\"â Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juice/water/fruits ??\", 'â Trip Verified |  \\nLisbon to Dubai in one of Emirates B777. The process at the airport was fairly efficient, considering that Lisbon airport can be very messy. The flight departed on time. Cabin is wide and very populated, but acceptably comfortable. The Inflight Entertainment is very good, the meals, although not as good as a few years ago, are still above the average for Economy class. The cabin crew is very nice and welcoming.', 'â Trip Verified |  Had the chance to travel in first class but this time with Emirates it was a complete different experience. The lounges, the suites, staff, food, shower on the A380, the limousine service, dedicated Lounge in Dubai, overpassed all my expectations. ', 'â Trip Verified |  I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated Iâd need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I donât think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we canât use. This is bordering on criminal if not unethical, Airlines are supposed to be helpful not members of the âWitâ family', 'â Trip Verified |  I have travelled a lot with Emirates but this time there was a very kind crew Gabriel Italian - Ukrainian with a very natural smiling radiating light. His attitude and love for his work was manifested in his kindness.', 'â Trip Verified |  Fantastic service from hostess Malek from Tunisia. Friendly and very efficient. Can see the passion for her job and love for Emirates. Lovely young lady with a great personality. Thank you.', 'â Trip Verified |  This must be the worst food I have ever tasted on an airline trip. Apart from the protein section of the main meal, the rest were inedible! The rolls were stale, rock hard so they were either old stock from previous meals or your caterer is taking advantage. Its carbs and carbs and carbs. Can you not include something fresh like fruit or fruit salad. Really bad Emirates, I was shocked! My earphones were also faulty, I informed the hostess and she said she will tend to it in a while but she never did.', 'Not Verified |  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who donât move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry thereâs nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldnât eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldnât fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they werenât ready) and didnât eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep. There was a nice attendant on the second flight who allowed me to stand up and eat a danish while my baby slept on my chair. Honestly if I could cancel my return flight and book with another airline I would. I will never ever fly with emirates again.', 'Not Verified | Unfortunately, my experience on Emirates airlines in economy class from Dubai to Paris CDG fell short of expectations. While I recognize economy class may not offer the same amenities as higher classes, I found the level of service and food to be subpar. Additionally, at Dubai airport, I was required to use an e-boarding pass, only to be informed upon arrival that a paper boarding pass was necessary, causing inconvenience. Furthermore, the air hostesses I encountered displayed a lack of professionalism and at times, seemed uninformed. Regrettably, based on this experience, I am uncertain if I would choose to fly with Emirates again.', \"â Trip Verified |  I usually don't write reviews but it was a terrible, expensive travel experience and unfortunately my return is already booked with them. There was numerous issues. Food was terrible. Menu was badly selected like there was no balance nor properly matched dishes. It didn't taste good either. Snacks were bad too. In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines. Emirates was the worst. Turkish airlines offers the best food and customer service. I will never fly with Emirates. Lead cabin crew had no English and wifi is not free as they advertise. \", \"Not Verified |  Due to winter storm in Chicago, they cancelled flight from Kochi to Dubai and Dubai to Chicago. The winter storm issue was with the second flight. But they cancelled first flight because they don't want us to stay in Dubai because it will cost them accommodations and food. They took  Americans because they have to and canceled our boarding pass after reaching gate and gave back our checked luggage. There were few passengers who had same problem because they told us to stay in our homes and didn't even have new flight to travel the following day. After endless number of calls, we got refund and booked Qatar airways with the same amount but as we booked the previous day,the ticket charge costed 1 lakh something more. But we paid because as it was urgent travelling for us. From that moment onwards we decided not to travel with Emirates. Will never forget the incident and crew was worst.\", 'â Trip Verified |  I recently flew with Emirates from Sydney to Prague, via Dubai. The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future. Highly recommend for those like myself who dread the long journey from Australia to Europe.', \"â Trip Verified |  My wife travelled on 6th may to Cochin to Auckland via Dubai. In checkin counter, they weighed even laptop bag also and she faced to pay around 27500INR for extra weight and spent around more than 2 hours in the checkin counter. Even if its as per the guidelines of airline this is the first experience we faced such a value less service. We travelled several air lines including low budget, they will not add the laptop in luggage weight due to their dignity. We saw number of persons facing the same. We didn't expected this type squeeze of money from Emirates\", 'â Trip Verified | Emirates has been the worst airline to deal with in terms of customer service. My mother travelled from Mumbai to Houston with a bag below maximum weight. In spite of that, the bag came with a wheel torn off. When we reported at the airline service desk, they took pictures and assured us that it would be processed very quickly. This was on March 25th. As of May 3rd, nothing! We called the call centers, multiple numbers, got handed around from one department to another who finally said, keep emailing as no one at the call center or baggage services number can help. Spoke to a supervisor from baggage services and all she could say was, please send the email to claims. I cannot help! Why is it called baggage services then!! My mom flies back in a few days and we are being forced to buy a new bag for her while waiting for Emirates to respond to a simple damaged bag claim! Such a hassle if anything goes wrong.', 'â Trip Verified |  Very disappointed when I approached the stewardess, (who was talking and laughing with a colleague) and asked for a red wine. She responded by saying, âit will be easier if you just go and ask at the kitchen at the back! Not the service you expect from Emirates.', \"â Trip Verified |  Flight crew prevented passengers from using the restroom 1 hr prior to landing. Very uncomfortable situation when there was no warning whatsoever. The seats are old and the monitors wobble when in flight. The food was bad and the other passengers didn't finish their meals. Never flying with them again\", 'â Trip Verified |  The quality is super too low. We lost one piece of an airpod at an Emirates EK354 bound to Singapore at 3.30AM local time. once everyone get off the plane, we inform the cabin crew that we lost which means that we seek their assistance to help find it. One cabin crew told âoh it would be so hard to findâ without helping us at all, just standing and staring. One flight manager help us instead to open the seat cover and finally we found it. Emirates is overrated for everything. Food taste was so bland, quality of the meat is very mediocre. Cabin crew issuper unfriendly. Seat is not comfortable we cant even sleep properly despite its an A380 (compared to Qantas and SQ).', 'Not Verified |  On 22 February, I was travelling in Business Class with my mother who was in a wheelchair on EK75. Check-in was smooth and hassle-free. Then, they took us to a dedicated Lounge for Special Handling which was a miserable and gloomy empty boarding lounge. As there was a Costa outlet, we wanted to have a coffee. The outlet was unstaffed and when we asked the dnata staff, she said that the outlet was closed and will remain closed. We were then taken to the boarding lounge. The boarding was done by self-boarding machines gantries. It took 30 seconds per passenger to scan the boarding pass prior to entering the lounge. The lounge was overcrowded. We waited for 50 minutes inside the boarding lounge without any announcement, nor anything on the screen. No information, no explanation for the delay. The ground handling was worse than a low-cost or a charter flight. a disgrace!', 'Not Verified |  A really good flight today on a long 16 hours and 40 minute flight, from AKL to DBX.  Very friendly, attentive crew. Got a good 6+ hours sleep. This was a new plane and everything was spotless and new looking. Toilet was clean. Food tasty and plenty of it with lots of drink and snack runs in between. Plenty of legroom, me being 1.8 metres tall. Entertainment is vast. If there is one criticism, itâs that the seats are quite hard for the length of the flight. A bit more padding would be welcome. All in all a very good flight.', 'â Trip Verified |  Check-in was easy at ICN but with a disappointing lounge situation, Emirates does not own a lounge at ICN. Inflight service was generally great although business class was quite full. Connection in Dubai was also not problematic; security for connecting passengers was fast-flowing and shopping and restaurants were open. Second flight was on a B777-300 but similar levels of comfort and service was  for business class. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), the in-flight service could experience delays as too many business class passengers are waiting to be served, the transit lounge at Dubai tend to be overcrowded and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In my case, the in-flight Internet could be purchased at $19,99 for a 10-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~8 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.', \"â Trip Verified |  A great airline with nice equipment and infrastructure, but its service (especially the ethnic flight attendants assigned to the airline's Korea service) could show some improvement. Slow service with some of the requests not honored as submitted (e.g., red wine given although white was requested), and felt like the flight attendants were not showing high levels of hospitality, on par with Emirates' reputation. Apart from this, great food and beverages selection and nice IFE system. Maybe the in-flight Internet could be revamped (price would be $19.99 for an 8-hour flight but would still block most high-bandwidth uses including streaming).\", 'â Trip Verified |  Mauritius to Dubai. Check-in was easy and also enjoyed priority immigration and security. Emirates uses the Air Mauritius lounge, and the lounge offered better than expected services. Inflight the flight attendants seemed to treat passengers with genuine hospitality: for the first time, felt that the bar at the back of business class cabin was a good place to relax. The food was great and good wine selections. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In-flight Internet could be purchased at $16.99 for a 6-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~4 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.', 'Not Verified |  What a terrible first time flight with this airline in old 2x3x2 seating in business class on both flights and flight attendants on the first running around very unorganised and bad food which was inedible. The whole meal is served on a tray. On the Mumbai to Johannesburg after take off crew passed out mattress tops and turned of lights and there was no service as their menu mentioned. Breakfast was served very quickly before landing. This Airline needs to learn about service of Singapore airlines and we would not fly with them again.', \"â Trip Verified |  Beware booking an Emirates codeshare. I am a current silver member and have booked a flight to Tashkent (Uzbekistan) from Cairo. As Emirates doesn't service Tashkent I was booked on a Fly Dubai (code share) instead. Little did I realise that this (slight) change meant that I do not qualify for lounge access. I, after a few misrepresntations and confusing messages, was advised that I needed to be a gold member to qualify. A transit time of over five hours didn't make that experience very pleasant. This little known fact was never mentioned anywhere during my online booking process. So, beware booking a code share with Emirates, there are strings attached.\", 'Not Verified |  Arriving at Sydney to fly back to the UK with Emirates we joined the âPremier Economy Online Checked-inâ queue expecting to quickly go to bag drop and then on to security but instead we soon found that this queue was three times longer than any others. Business/First class was short and the queue for those whoâd not checked in at all was barely longer - only the checked-in passengers appeared to be stuck in a 45 minute queue. I tried to ask a member of the check-in staff if we were in the right queue and she just curtly told me yes, I was, without even asking or understanding our passenger class, so basically just a blatant lie to my face. We havenât actually reached the aircraft yet but already know that we wonât be travelling with Emirates again any time soon.', 'â Trip Verified |  Due to my physical condition, I fly in Business and always request wheelchair assistance. Emirates treatment and service on my Delhi/Barcelona flight (April 3rd) has been horrible. On the first flight EK 513 from Delhi to Dubai, I notified my situation and asked to the crew that, since the connection time to my flight to Barcelona was 1 hour 55 minutes, they would check that I was picked up from the plane quickly. The cabin staff told me \"don\\'t worry\". Upon arrival they told me that I had to wait because there was no finger but stairs. After a while and seeing how nervous I was getting, a first class attendant approached me and told me that she would take my luggage and help me down the stairs because if I didn\\'t take the bus on the runway, I wouldn\\'t make it to the flight to Barcelona. On the bus there was a person in an Emirates uniform who I asked if she could help me when I got to the terminal to locate a wheelchair because he had very short connection time, he refused! Upon arrival at the terminal there were no wheelchairs, I made it with difficulty to the wheelchair request point and, from there they had me getting on and off several buggies and, luckily, the driver of the last buggy helped me with the luggage to Arrive at the plane after the closing time of the flight. How is it possible that Emirates have not foreseen all this when, the user, requests this help service at the time of purchasing the ticket, therefore, sufficiently in advance? How did they not notify the terminal from the plane that I was arriving with special needs so that someone with a wheelchair or buggy? It is a shame.', \"â Trip Verified | \\nI remember that we were very satisfied with this airline until a few years ago. But now it has been 3 times that we are very dissatisfied with the quality of food and the number of times served on a long flight! Why should we feel hungry on such a long flight and when we asked for food, they only give a small packet of crackers and we have to wait for several hours until it is time to serve their disgusting food? It was not like that before, that's why we surprised!\", 'Not Verified |  I was pleasantly surprised by level of service and experience on this flight. Everything went smooth, food was very tasty, great choices of dishes and beverages. Overall, staff was very helpful always trying to accommodate the customer needs', 'â Trip Verified |  My son had vomited on a flight where my partner had left his seat to request assistance. He had gone to the adjoining cabin where he was ignored. My partner then spoke with an attendant, who started serving drinks/ meal in our cabin, who came to assess the situation and then continued to serve drinks and ignore us. From my seat, I had tried to call out to another FA, who also was serving drinks/ meals in our cabin, however did not acknowledge us. I raised my voice to attract attention to no avail. Another attendant who walked past, I had shouted for assistance, who stopped and provided help. Both the other FAs on separate occasions when approaching to serve us, had apologised and began to excuse their busy schedule but was unable to advise why they did not call for additional assistance. I spoke to a senior attendant, who apologised and advised the approach taken is not protocol and should not have happened.', 'â Trip Verified |  So we paid Â£4K for 4 tickets to be upgraded to business class, the family wanted to try it out so I thought letâs do it. We checked in at the business class dedicated desk and were advised by the Emirates staff to proceed to gate 7 where we will find the lounge. Hand tickets over and told you donât have access, no explanation just handed back by some power enjoying jobs worth with no options offered. I was stunned. Checked Emirates website and it clearly states our class of travel has lounge access. This is very frustrating and an underhanded approach from Emirates. Turns out this is correct, but why on earth donât you train staff to explain this or clearly print on the ticket / emailed ticket / purchase confirmation. This must cause so many issues at the airport for people. You buy business class tickets you always get the lounge - so I thought. A very poor decision on Emirates behalf if you ask me. What a disappointment.', 'â Trip Verified |  Coming from Orlando on a very long flight, the plan departed 2h late and landed late, which caused missing our connection. I have travelled with 2 kids so coming from a 12h long flight and being greeted with a voucher for few meals preselected by airlines (like an apple and tomato sandwich, banana and noodle soupâ¦things that are super unpleasant for kids to start with) super cheap offering and I have to get stuck for almost 5h on the airport with two extremely tired kids with no comfort and proper food due to airline mistake. When I asked the customer support desk to arrange for us at least a lounge or upgrade (min expected from them ), he was so rude and said this is âthe bestâ he will offer and turned his back. So I was extremely disappointed to experience such a treatment from such an airline, they donât take responsibility to what is their mistake and my feedback is not bothering them at all. The real Emirates service is not the one they advertise to hook you up!', 'Not Verified |  My experience onboard Emirates was a good one. The IFE was great, food was good and so was the cabin service. The airline though sent a 777 with the old cabin from Bengaluru to Dubai, which was not so bad, but made me a bit disappointed. The next flight from Dubai to Washington DC also was served by a Boeing 777, but with the latest cabin with a new, big, modern IFE screen and a brighter cabin, which made a difference for the better. Apart from the old cabin, I found the legroom to be quite a bit lesser than what I initially thought. Perhaps I should try the Airbus A380 if I am to get a better experience. But the 777s were also equally nice, at least in Economy. Since I was flying during Covid time, I was also a tad bit disappointed over no hot towels and menu cards in Economy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this airline.', 'â Trip Verified |\\xa0\\xa0I had an exceptional flight, the staff were considerate and polite.

The service has gone downhill since i last flown with them. There was no drinks services or menu cards, it was not a full flight so had the whole row of seats to myself which i utilised as a bed. The A380-800 is a great plane to fly, plenty of seat and leg room and alo very quiet. The 2nd journey was completely different, the Boeing 777-300er was old, very narrow with limited leg room, the engines were loud,t he comment âcattle classâ comes to mind, there was a vietnamese couple sat next to me, the crew thought i was with them and handed me the same meal & drinks as them, luckily i wanted the same meal as them, she then realised that we were not together when i spoke and asked for a different drink. The crew seemed to lack interest. I would fly with them again but only because of their competitive price', \"â Trip Verified |  I would not have bought the Emirates tickets if I knew I was flying with Qantas.

Waste of money! 800NZD for round ticket AKL to MEL. Done with Emirates and Qantas (I didn't even choose Qantas). Will stick with my fav airlines Qatar and AirNZ!\", 'â Trip Verified |  Worst traveling experience in last 20 years of business and leisure traveling. They tried to force me to give my hand carry bag to luggage. To do so, they wasted my time, asked me to stand on the side and made me go and talk to lot of different people. They argue that I can not have hand carry bag and laptop bag separately. To make the situation worst another ground staff at the time of entering plane stopped me and pressurized me to board the plane with just laptop bag (which anyway going to be in my legroom).  On many occasions, I paid extra and chose Emirates for the service and comfort which seems to be a thing of a past. From now on I will never choose Emirates if I have an option.', 'Not Verified |  This was a nightmare and the most horrible airline Iâve ever taken in my life. Unfriendly staff. Customer care is zero. Whatever I asked for wasnât done. I needed my seat switched so the crew told me to go look for a seat. Passengers were pretty annoyed of me asking around when she shouldâve done that herself to avoid this. Asked for couple things itâs either not available like (tissues) or a mask? Food is terrible. Flight was late so now I will be missing my connection.', \"â Trip Verified |  On the Emirates return flight from Kolkata there was no option to pay for extra baggage during online check in even though the Emirates website mentions that passengers should be paying for extra baggage during check in to save money. The option to do so was greyed out and unavailable. I ended up paying the equivalent to $270.00 CAD for 1 extra luggage at the Emirates counter at the airport during baggage drop off. I called Emirates to complain and the customer service said itâs because it is a connecting flight from Kolkata and that option is not available. It shouldn't matter because i paid only $100 CAD during the Air Canada check in to Dubai for a stop over on the way to Kolkata. On top of that Emirates didn't update me by email or text messages after online check in. I think Emirates has really bad customer service and I will never fly with this airline again.\", 'â Trip Verified |  Ground staff are very unfriendly and not helpful, making my trip unpleasant to start up with.

I may not want to fly Emirates in the future.', \"Not Verified |  Overrated airline. This was my first flight with Emirates after having heard so much hype about it for many years now. Previously I have flown with Qatar airways on the same route. Cons: Terrible seating, very cramped and narrow, not enough space to even move feet. Very little quantity of food - hardly 2-3 spoons of 3 items each, plus bun and butter. Water/drinks served only twice in 6.5 hour flight. No response despite pressing button for assistance. In-flight entertainment sucks. My seat's screen had touchscreen that did not work. Overpriced tickets. Too much walking in Dubai, no buggy service. \", 'â Trip Verified |  In December 2022 I travelled from Sydney to Dubai with Emirates First Class. I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful. Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year. Totally not worth the money or air miles.', \"â Trip Verified |  I was quite disappointed given how much I paid for the ticket. I had a business trip in Hong Kong and I returned from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The airport was huge but the Emirates ground service was very poor. There was some issues at the check in counter causing me to wait at least half hour for my turn to check in luggage. The seats at the economy class is good, on par with other airlines. The cabin crews are nice and helpful and it seems the cabin crew are all coming from different countries but I don't any Emirati or Middle Eastern cabin crew. I wish there are more Asian food options (I'm Thai) on food instead of Middle Eastern/Arabic food. The inflight entertainment was okay, nothing surprising. With the whole flight experience, I think it is not value for money. Will take other airlines next time instead.\", \"â Trip Verified |  Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days). To get on that flight from Bahrain to London I have to pay a 200GBP 'change fee' and the difference in fare - for a flight that I have already paid for, and that I would have made. \", \"Not Verified |  This is, by far, the best flight I have ever been on! I would give this way more than 10/10 if I could! Food: Meals, drinks, and snacks were absolutely delicious, especially the pizza, turkey sandwich, and more!

Staff: Don't get me started! They were amazing. They attended to all our needs. Hot water? They got you. Lost headphones? They got you. Never seen a nicer staff. Entertainment: Did not exactly broaden to all my interests, but headphones were fully immersive. Amnesties: Oh my god, there's so many! Reclining seat. Bathroom lotion. Goodies bag with toothbrushing tools. The list is endless!\", 'Not Verified |  This was the worst flight I have ever had. Poor customer service from start to end. I flew with Emirates from Gatwick to Dubai with my partner and 5 children. My 4 year old son is Autistic. Their level of service on board is awful, food was below standards. I kept on pressing the assistant bell and no one came over to assist me. I was only served drinks twice on a 7 hour flight. Toilets on board were disgusting. Seats are uncomfortable. I was expecting more from Emirates especially when travelling with a child with a disability.

I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines. If you need wheelchair assistance at Dubai Airport, do not fly with Emirates.\", 'â Trip Verified | Had a very good experience with Emirates. Crew was very enthusiastic and attentive and the food delicious- how often do you eat everything served on a flight? Mediocre service on the ground though, a 20 min bus ride from the plane in DXB, long wait for baggage in CPH and no bag tag available at self service in DXB. Would still highly recommend EK.', 'â Trip Verified |  I landed in Dubai on the 27th Jan in transit to Perth, with a 19hrs layover. When I inquired about accommodation I was told by Emirates staff that they could not help because I did not book it in advance. At no point during the booking I was notified I needed to request accommodation in advance. I had to spend 19 hours at the airport because I did not have any cash to book a hotel at my expense. Will definitely think twice before flying Emirates again.', 'â Trip Verified | The airline was very good. The boarding experience was good. The flight was on time. There was a blanket, a pillow and a headrest on the seat. The seat was comfortable and cabin crew was  helpful and polite. The service was also very good, and the food tasted amazing. The in flight entertainment is the best  and you will never get bored. Overall I think this is a very good airline and definitely worth flying with. I will fly Emirates again.', 'â Trip Verified |  We traveled with a group of 5, going to Karachi via Dubai was great as we were able to pay to upgrade to business class. On the return flight we were not able to pay for the upgrade option as there was no availability. From the check in counter at the Karachi airport to the transfer of the wheel chair passenger (with me) to the flight back to Houston the experience was horrible. The person working at the emirates counter in Karachi asking for a indirect bribe to the incompetent staff at the Dubai airport making us wait like a hour for wheel chair staff to transport us to the lounge as we waited for the connecting flight. When I asked to make sure we the wheel chair passengers are taken to the plaza lounge he asked how I had access I stated through Amex Business platinum. It was non of his business as an Emirates employee to ask to see my card for a lounge. The service on the plane was horrible. Full of very overworked and tired flight staff that looked worn out and unhappy. Not sure I will fly with Emirates after this.', 'â Trip Verified |  Emirates used to be a good airline once upon a time. The airline quality, attitude of staff and service is absolutely horrible. The boarding process and the attitude of staff during boarding is very arrogant. They have no concept of service. The aircraft is clean but not as clean as it used to be. I saw stained seats.  The cabin crew are very young and inexperienced. When the aircraft had barely touched down and passengers were off their seats and the cabin crew did nothing. The approx wait time for bag arrival is about one hour.', 'â Trip Verified | I am astonished to read the number of negative reviews this airline receives. I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork. Maybe its the luck of the draw, but I personally think Emirates is tops.', 'Not Verified |  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew. Absolutely appalling customer service. Every customer should think twice about using Emirates unless they are happy to be treated very unfairly when something does wrong.', \"â Trip Verified |  This complaint regarding Baggage Services. I fly from Dhaka, Bangladesh to New York and connection was in Dubai. When I landed in NY one of my luggage was missing and they told me that it was last traced in Dubai. Today, it's been 7 days and when I call customer service they are keep telling me that they couldn't find the baggage, they are looking into all the airports which sound very stupid. Everyday when I call them they are keep telling me that they are escalating to higher authority. Also they are ensuring me that I will receive a call back in 24 hours which never happened in last 7 days.

I am afraid of losing the flight and am still being ignored after about an hour and 15 min.  This company doesnât have the most basic respect for the passengers! Economy class passengers are human beings too. I try to avoid wheelchairs but airports and the long walking distances with all the luggage are a challenge. They do not even start to check in economy before all business passengers are gone. They donât even pretend to care! I donât know if I am going to a developed country anymore. The introduction is not good. When I finally got assistance, the lady helping me was extremely nice (Mariluz). Value for money - a waste of money Ground service below horrifying.', 'Not Verified |  Incredibly poor experience for such an incredibly expensive flight. We flew from Milan to New York with a connection to Atlanta. We were held on the tarmac for almost an hour and a half with no explanation. Not surprisingly, we missed our flight. I went to the counter to get rebooked to a new one. It took 2 hours for the (extremely rude) customer service representative to offer me a flight 24 hours later and a motel (1/5 star review on Google). They insisted nothing else was available even though we were seeing tons of availability on our own. Furthermore, they told us we would get reimbursed for ubers and food during the 24 hours. I contacted Emirates several times and have had no such luck in getting reimbursed. They completely ignore you. Will never fly Emirates again despite the name brand. ', 'Not Verified |  I canât believe Iâm writing this about Emirates since Iâve been flying with them for years but their customer service has gone down dramatically! I donât know if itâs because they donât pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardessâs are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They donât want to do any hard work. Canât even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely donât get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I donât know if they changed the catering? Total waste of my money and time. I should have flown Qatar Airways where you get your own cabin (with sliding door for privacy) and the air hostess are super kind and friendly. Only for $300 itâs totally worth it. Learned my lesson! Never again Emirates!', 'â Trip Verified |\\xa0\\xa0My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn\\'t smile, weren\\'t friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me \"this way, please,\" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn\\'t offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it\\'s not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn\\'t be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times! I will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices. However, i do hope to see friendlier faces in future.', 'â Trip Verified |  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didnât order it, Then why was it an option and it didnât have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didnât eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasnât warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight. They say Emirates is a number 1 airline in the world and flying them is almost a privilege, but I disagree, Sorry.', 'â Trip Verified | Though Emirates only operates a handful of flights to and from Milan, it maintains a nice, spacious lounge with ample seating and good selections of food. I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent. However, I did encounter one of the nicest attendants in the sky.', 'Not Verified |  Do not trust them. Worst Airline and customer service. Purchased the ticket in full. Was issued E-ticket via email. Arrived to destination. On the return leg flight, was refused check in. Printed and presented at the check in. Upon presenting, the passenger was advised that the ticket is not valid and the seat that was booked in not available. Advised to purchase another ticket. When told that the ticket was all paid for and e-ticket was presented, they advised that they canât do anything and advised to contact customer care. The check in closed and the flight departed. No money was returned. After contacting the customer service, advised to lodge an investigation. When asked what to do for the time being, they advised to purchase another ticket and deal with complaints department. Another ticket was purchased. Both customer service team and complaints department advised that they cannot do anything and to deal with the bank. When challenged the decisions, the both departments simply engorged communication. Ended up being double the money out of pocket and no explanation. Would never fly again with this shade company and will advise everyone to avoid as this can happen to anyone. Because the head office is overseas, no local governing agency have any power to challenge them. Be careful and stay away.', \"â Trip Verified |  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that âit wasn't their faultâ. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok. (Drinks actually very nice), crew was a mix of friendly, hard-working people and some who couldnât care less.\", 'â Trip Verified | This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to âno spaceâ on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and whatâs worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I donât remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. Iâm not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didnât seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and thatâs how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out. ', 'â Trip Verified |  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate \\'fare differences\\'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your \\'fare type\\' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you\\'re on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you\\'re lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of Â£100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a \\'fare difference\\' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or \"officer\")', 'â Trip Verified | Reserved Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Dhaka via Dubai.

When they provided me meal I couldnât open my table as while holding baby table couldnât be opened. I barely ate a little and gave up.

You can lay on your back quite comfortably but I don\\'t know how a bigger person will be comfortable especially on long haul flights. In each of the 4 legs at every meal time, the flight attendant asked me \" do you want to eat dinner/ lunch/ brunch?\". Of course I would. Where would I go for sustenance on a 15 hour flight? It\\'s not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn\\'t really a vegan meal.

What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern.

The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead.

After a couple of attempts, they made some adjustments and sorted out the issue a few hours later. My booking could not process payment due to a pricing problem between the airlines. After numerous failed attempts over 3 days via customer service and live chats, failed rebooking attempts for the same route, and empty promises from customer agents calling me back, I finally just booked another date to ensure that we can at least spend Christmas together. NEVER in my life have I experienced any issues like this with Qatar (or any other airlines for that matter). Emirates advertise routes and when it comes to booking, they're not able to process and if they do process, they do a half-ass job which leaves customers feeling stressed and running around trying to finalize flight details.

At no point was any offer made regarding accommodation or alternate flight and, again, we were encouraged to accept that our daughter would have to travel next to a random stranger and presumably feed herself hot meals throughout the 7 hour flight. And then as the doors were about to be shut 2 seats together were suddenly found! When I complained formally about the distress this all caused, a curt reply was sent denying that seats had been changed at check in. My view of this airline feels irreparable damaged and I simply wouldnât trust them with providing a reliable and safe journey in the future when they cannot even look properly at what went wrong on this occasion.', \"â Trip Verified |  Outbound (BAH TO DXB): Smooth flight, generous amount of food for such a short flight and it was tasty as well Outbound (DXB to BHX): Disastrous, flight was overbooked and cramped making the staff take a long time to board, we economy passengers were basically treated like cattle. IFE wasn't responsive, and food especially breakfast were bad - portions fit for a child, and mid flight I realized the meals had given me stomach pains and nausea. Inbound (BHX to DXB): Extremely bad service, 3 hours after take off and nothing (not even drinks) were given, my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally, it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals (including my seat mate). Besides that, my meal was terrible barely cooked pasta with a droplet of sauce, dead vegetables that was pathetically called a salad, and I was given a bread roll with nothing to use it with. Crew barely served any drinks, I got massively dehydrated (7hrs flight), and in the morning they refused to serve me breakfast because I woke up 2 hours before landing - not even a coffee or tea was offered to me. Overall, it's was a very below average flight and Emirates is overhyped for nothing.\", 'â Trip Verified |  The flight in which i travelled from Dubai to Amsterdam turned out to be the worst experience by Emirates. Water was dripping from the roof and the crew took it very lightly. They were responding that we have informed to our manager, but no actions were taken about it till i landed in Amsterdam. I literally had to hold and sit with the plastic cover they had given as the blanket cover for most of the distance.', 'Not Verified |  I had booked return flights with wheelchair service for my 60 year old Mom for AMD to DFW and back. The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my motherâs health and age.  While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesnât have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed? Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but âHer wheelchair is bookedâ. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airport from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was âOur staff will be there to assist her everywhereâ. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with nobody to help. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter. I genuinely liked Emirates but this is very disappointing and inconvenient especially given that mother is a senior citizen. Iâll never fly emirates again.', \"Not Verified |  Having purchased first class tickets for my wife and I to return to New Zealand in January we were very much looking forward to our return journey having booked business class on the outbound flights from New Zealand. The booking was made and fully paid for four months ago. I have been advised by curt email that I have been downgraded to business class, no mention of apology, explanation nor compensation or refund. It gets better, there seems no way of contacting Emirates in New Zealand their advertised phone number is cut off. What a shambles of an airline and we haven't even left the ground. This is how they treat premium paying clients, forget it. Book with another airline, never again!\", 'â Trip Verified |  My first experience of Emirates new premium economy class. Food and service excellent. Seats however are a little bit firm and not as comfortable as the pictures suggest. Also the recline is quite big so you can feel a little trapped once the person in front refines. Access to three toilets for 50 plus passengers is a real bonus and you get glimpses of the flight deck if that is an interest. I paid very little in cost difference which was the attraction but Emirates economy is very good in any case so May not always be a choice I am willing to pay much extra for. Also it was a two meal service for a seven hour flight which is good.', 'Not Verified |  My sister flew from Houston to Tehran via Dubai. In Houston, she paid $225 for an extra suitcase. The agent asked for cash and said they do not accept credit card but after my sister insisting that she does not have cash, they accepted her credit card.  Upon her arrival to Dubai for her second leg of her flight, she was asked to pay over $300 again. When she showed her receipt and the destination noted, the agent started to scream at her and say, either she pays or she will lose her flight. When she tried to reason, the man started to scream more and louder, and took her passport. My sister told him that she will pay, just tell her how to do it. Then the agent took her to a counter and when she went to pay, the price was increased to $350. She paid with credit card and they wanted the pin to her credit card. She told them the she did not have the PIN as this was not debit.  She decided to pay in cash, so she can leave but the agent got on her face. She was handed a repeat for $285 and she did not get her change back out of $400.  Now, I am scrambling in Houston to find a return flight for her, so she does not have to return to Dubai and moreover, to travel with Emirate. ', 'â Trip Verified |  When I fly from Jakarta to Zurich transit Dubai on 19 august the cabin crew was unpolite, Isit in the middle between my husband and my daughter, they ask my husband and my daughter for dinner but did not ask me so I call the bell for dinner and told that I am running out of food choices. Very disappointing.', 'â Trip Verified |  Wish I had read these reviews. I paid over Â£2,500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. Iâm travelling with my wife and 2 babies (1 &2.5 years old). The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours, they suddenly decided to change my original flights, booked only 10 days before, theyâve sent me a text and a short email to say: this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he canât help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we canât answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers. Not only are we devastated but also out of pocket by Â£2,500 because we canât possibly go on their imposed alternative flight of 21.5 hours with 2 small restless babies. ', 'â Trip Verified | We chose to book a more expensive flight due to shorter transit time in Dubai. However, just a few weeks before our flight, Emirates, without giving us any options, just changed our flight date and a much longer transit time in Dubai, no offer for a hotel overnight stay. In ZH, they have no office, nor could we contact their phone no. It is a frustrating and a sad first time try with Emirates.']\n",

      "[\"I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juice/water/fruits ??\", 'Lisbon to Dubai in one of Emirates B777. The process at the airport was fairly efficient, considering that Lisbon airport can be very messy. The flight departed on time. Cabin is wide and very populated, but acceptably comfortable. The Inflight Entertainment is very good, the meals, although not as good as a few years ago, are still above the average for Economy class. The cabin crew is very nice and welcoming.', 'Had the chance to travel in first class but this time with Emirates it was a complete different experience. The lounges, the suites, staff, food, shower on the A380, the limousine service, dedicated Lounge in Dubai, overpassed all my expectations.', 'I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated Iâd need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I donât think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we canât use. This is bordering on criminal if not unethical, Airlines are supposed to be helpful not members of the âWitâ family', 'I have travelled a lot with Emirates but this time there was a very kind crew Gabriel Italian - Ukrainian with a very natural smiling radiating light. His attitude and love for his work was manifested in his kindness.', 'Fantastic service from hostess Malek from Tunisia. Friendly and very efficient. Can see the passion for her job and love for Emirates. Lovely young lady with a great personality. Thank you.', 'This must be the worst food I have ever tasted on an airline trip. Apart from the protein section of the main meal, the rest were inedible! The rolls were stale, rock hard so they were either old stock from previous meals or your caterer is taking advantage. Its carbs and carbs and carbs. Can you not include something fresh like fruit or fruit salad. Really bad Emirates, I was shocked! My earphones were also faulty, I informed the hostess and she said she will tend to it in a while but she never did.', 'I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who donât move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry thereâs nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldnât eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldnât fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they werenât ready) and didnât eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep. There was a nice attendant on the second flight who allowed me to stand up and eat a danish while my baby slept on my chair. Honestly if I could cancel my return flight and book with another airline I would. I will never ever fly with emirates again.', 'Unfortunately, my experience on Emirates airlines in economy class from Dubai to Paris CDG fell short of expectations. While I recognize economy class may not offer the same amenities as higher classes, I found the level of service and food to be subpar. Additionally, at Dubai airport, I was required to use an e-boarding pass, only to be informed upon arrival that a paper boarding pass was necessary, causing inconvenience. Furthermore, the air hostesses I encountered displayed a lack of professionalism and at times, seemed uninformed. Regrettably, based on this experience, I am uncertain if I would choose to fly with Emirates again.', \"I usually don't write reviews but it was a terrible, expensive travel experience and unfortunately my return is already booked with them. There was numerous issues. Food was terrible. Menu was badly selected like there was no balance nor properly matched dishes. It didn't taste good either. Snacks were bad too. In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines. Emirates was the worst. Turkish airlines offers the best food and customer service. I will never fly with Emirates. Lead cabin crew had no English and wifi is not free as they advertise.\", \"Due to winter storm in Chicago, they cancelled flight from Kochi to Dubai and Dubai to Chicago. The winter storm issue was with the second flight. But they cancelled first flight because they don't want us to stay in Dubai because it will cost them accommodations and food. They took  Americans because they have to and canceled our boarding pass after reaching gate and gave back our checked luggage. There were few passengers who had same problem because they told us to stay in our homes and didn't even have new flight to travel the following day. After endless number of calls, we got refund and booked Qatar airways with the same amount but as we booked the previous day,the ticket charge costed 1 lakh something more. But we paid because as it was urgent travelling for us. From that moment onwards we decided not to travel with Emirates. Will never forget the incident and crew was worst.\", 'I recently flew with Emirates from Sydney to Prague, via Dubai. The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future. Highly recommend for those like myself who dread the long journey from Australia to Europe.', \"My wife travelled on 6th may to Cochin to Auckland via Dubai. In checkin counter, they weighed even laptop bag also and she faced to pay around 27500INR for extra weight and spent around more than 2 hours in the checkin counter. Even if its as per the guidelines of airline this is the first experience we faced such a value less service. We travelled several air lines including low budget, they will not add the laptop in luggage weight due to their dignity. We saw number of persons facing the same. We didn't expected this type squeeze of money from Emirates\", 'Emirates has been the worst airline to deal with in terms of customer service. My mother travelled from Mumbai to Houston with a bag below maximum weight. In spite of that, the bag came with a wheel torn off. When we reported at the airline service desk, they took pictures and assured us that it would be processed very quickly. This was on March 25th. As of May 3rd, nothing! We called the call centers, multiple numbers, got handed around from one department to another who finally said, keep emailing as no one at the call center or baggage services number can help. Spoke to a supervisor from baggage services and all she could say was, please send the email to claims. I cannot help! Why is it called baggage services then!! My mom flies back in a few days and we are being forced to buy a new bag for her while waiting for Emirates to respond to a simple damaged bag claim! Such a hassle if anything goes wrong.', 'Very disappointed when I approached the stewardess, (who was talking and laughing with a colleague) and asked for a red wine. She responded by saying, âit will be easier if you just go and ask at the kitchen at the back! Not the service you expect from Emirates.', \"Flight crew prevented passengers from using the restroom 1 hr prior to landing. Very uncomfortable situation when there was no warning whatsoever. The seats are old and the monitors wobble when in flight. The food was bad and the other passengers didn't finish their meals. Never flying with them again\", 'The quality is super too low. We lost one piece of an airpod at an Emirates EK354 bound to Singapore at 3.30AM local time. once everyone get off the plane, we inform the cabin crew that we lost which means that we seek their assistance to help find it. One cabin crew told âoh it would be so hard to findâ without helping us at all, just standing and staring. One flight manager help us instead to open the seat cover and finally we found it. Emirates is overrated for everything. Food taste was so bland, quality of the meat is very mediocre. Cabin crew issuper unfriendly. Seat is not comfortable we cant even sleep properly despite its an A380 (compared to Qantas and SQ).', 'On 22 February, I was travelling in Business Class with my mother who was in a wheelchair on EK75. Check-in was smooth and hassle-free. Then, they took us to a dedicated Lounge for Special Handling which was a miserable and gloomy empty boarding lounge. As there was a Costa outlet, we wanted to have a coffee. The outlet was unstaffed and when we asked the dnata staff, she said that the outlet was closed and will remain closed. We were then taken to the boarding lounge. The boarding was done by self-boarding machines gantries. It took 30 seconds per passenger to scan the boarding pass prior to entering the lounge. The lounge was overcrowded. We waited for 50 minutes inside the boarding lounge without any announcement, nor anything on the screen. No information, no explanation for the delay. The ground handling was worse than a low-cost or a charter flight. a disgrace!', 'A really good flight today on a long 16 hours and 40 minute flight, from AKL to DBX.  Very friendly, attentive crew. Got a good 6+ hours sleep. This was a new plane and everything was spotless and new looking. Toilet was clean. Food tasty and plenty of it with lots of drink and snack runs in between. Plenty of legroom, me being 1.8 metres tall. Entertainment is vast. If there is one criticism, itâs that the seats are quite hard for the length of the flight. A bit more padding would be welcome. All in all a very good flight.', 'Check-in was easy at ICN but with a disappointing lounge situation, Emirates does not own a lounge at ICN. Inflight service was generally great although business class was quite full. Connection in Dubai was also not problematic; security for connecting passengers was fast-flowing and shopping and restaurants were open. Second flight was on a B777-300 but similar levels of comfort and service was  for business class. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), the in-flight service could experience delays as too many business class passengers are waiting to be served, the transit lounge at Dubai tend to be overcrowded and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In my case, the in-flight Internet could be purchased at $19,99 for a 10-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~8 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.', \"A great airline with nice equipment and infrastructure, but its service (especially the ethnic flight attendants assigned to the airline's Korea service) could show some improvement. Slow service with some of the requests not honored as submitted (e.g., red wine given although white was requested), and felt like the flight attendants were not showing high levels of hospitality, on par with Emirates' reputation. Apart from this, great food and beverages selection and nice IFE system. Maybe the in-flight Internet could be revamped (price would be $19.99 for an 8-hour flight but would still block most high-bandwidth uses including streaming).\", 'Mauritius to Dubai. Check-in was easy and also enjoyed priority immigration and security. Emirates uses the Air Mauritius lounge, and the lounge offered better than expected services. Inflight the flight attendants seemed to treat passengers with genuine hospitality: for the first time, felt that the bar at the back of business class cabin was a good place to relax. The food was great and good wine selections. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In-flight Internet could be purchased at $16.99 for a 6-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~4 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.', 'What a terrible first time flight with this airline in old 2x3x2 seating in business class on both flights and flight attendants on the first running around very unorganised and bad food which was inedible. The whole meal is served on a tray. On the Mumbai to Johannesburg after take off crew passed out mattress tops and turned of lights and there was no service as their menu mentioned. Breakfast was served very quickly before landing. This Airline needs to learn about service of Singapore airlines and we would not fly with them again.', \"Beware booking an Emirates codeshare. I am a current silver member and have booked a flight to Tashkent (Uzbekistan) from Cairo. As Emirates doesn't service Tashkent I was booked on a Fly Dubai (code share) instead. Little did I realise that this (slight) change meant that I do not qualify for lounge access. I, after a few misrepresntations and confusing messages, was advised that I needed to be a gold member to qualify. A transit time of over five hours didn't make that experience very pleasant. This little known fact was never mentioned anywhere during my online booking process. So, beware booking a code share with Emirates, there are strings attached.\", 'Arriving at Sydney to fly back to the UK with Emirates we joined the âPremier Economy Online Checked-inâ queue expecting to quickly go to bag drop and then on to security but instead we soon found that this queue was three times longer than any others. Business/First class was short and the queue for those whoâd not checked in at all was barely longer - only the checked-in passengers appeared to be stuck in a 45 minute queue. I tried to ask a member of the check-in staff if we were in the right queue and she just curtly told me yes, I was, without even asking or understanding our passenger class, so basically just a blatant lie to my face. We havenât actually reached the aircraft yet but already know that we wonât be travelling with Emirates again any time soon.', 'Due to my physical condition, I fly in Business and always request wheelchair assistance. Emirates treatment and service on my Delhi/Barcelona flight (April 3rd) has been horrible. On the first flight EK 513 from Delhi to Dubai, I notified my situation and asked to the crew that, since the connection time to my flight to Barcelona was 1 hour 55 minutes, they would check that I was picked up from the plane quickly. The cabin staff told me \"don\\'t worry\". Upon arrival they told me that I had to wait because there was no finger but stairs. After a while and seeing how nervous I was getting, a first class attendant approached me and told me that she would take my luggage and help me down the stairs because if I didn\\'t take the bus on the runway, I wouldn\\'t make it to the flight to Barcelona. On the bus there was a person in an Emirates uniform who I asked if she could help me when I got to the terminal to locate a wheelchair because he had very short connection time, he refused! Upon arrival at the terminal there were no wheelchairs, I made it with difficulty to the wheelchair request point and, from there they had me getting on and off several buggies and, luckily, the driver of the last buggy helped me with the luggage to Arrive at the plane after the closing time of the flight. How is it possible that Emirates have not foreseen all this when, the user, requests this help service at the time of purchasing the ticket, therefore, sufficiently in advance? How did they not notify the terminal from the plane that I was arriving with special needs so that someone with a wheelchair or buggy? It is a shame.', \"I remember that we were very satisfied with this airline until a few years ago. But now it has been 3 times that we are very dissatisfied with the quality of food and the number of times served on a long flight! Why should we feel hungry on such a long flight and when we asked for food, they only give a small packet of crackers and we have to wait for several hours until it is time to serve their disgusting food? It was not like that before, that's why we surprised!\", 'I was pleasantly surprised by level of service and experience on this flight. Everything went smooth, food was very tasty, great choices of dishes and beverages. Overall, staff was very helpful always trying to accommodate the customer needs', 'My son had vomited on a flight where my partner had left his seat to request assistance. He had gone to the adjoining cabin where he was ignored. My partner then spoke with an attendant, who started serving drinks/ meal in our cabin, who came to assess the situation and then continued to serve drinks and ignore us. From my seat, I had tried to call out to another FA, who also was serving drinks/ meals in our cabin, however did not acknowledge us. I raised my voice to attract attention to no avail. Another attendant who walked past, I had shouted for assistance, who stopped and provided help. Both the other FAs on separate occasions when approaching to serve us, had apologised and began to excuse their busy schedule but was unable to advise why they did not call for additional assistance. I spoke to a senior attendant, who apologised and advised the approach taken is not protocol and should not have happened.', 'So we paid Â£4K for 4 tickets to be upgraded to business class, the family wanted to try it out so I thought letâs do it. We checked in at the business class dedicated desk and were advised by the Emirates staff to proceed to gate 7 where we will find the lounge. Hand tickets over and told you donât have access, no explanation just handed back by some power enjoying jobs worth with no options offered. I was stunned. Checked Emirates website and it clearly states our class of travel has lounge access. This is very frustrating and an underhanded approach from Emirates. Turns out this is correct, but why on earth donât you train staff to explain this or clearly print on the ticket / emailed ticket / purchase confirmation. This must cause so many issues at the airport for people. You buy business class tickets you always get the lounge - so I thought. A very poor decision on Emirates behalf if you ask me. What a disappointment.', 'Coming from Orlando on a very long flight, the plan departed 2h late and landed late, which caused missing our connection. I have travelled with 2 kids so coming from a 12h long flight and being greeted with a voucher for few meals preselected by airlines (like an apple and tomato sandwich, banana and noodle soupâ¦things that are super unpleasant for kids to start with) super cheap offering and I have to get stuck for almost 5h on the airport with two extremely tired kids with no comfort and proper food due to airline mistake. When I asked the customer support desk to arrange for us at least a lounge or upgrade (min expected from them ), he was so rude and said this is âthe bestâ he will offer and turned his back. So I was extremely disappointed to experience such a treatment from such an airline, they donât take responsibility to what is their mistake and my feedback is not bothering them at all. The real Emirates service is not the one they advertise to hook you up!', 'My experience onboard Emirates was a good one. The IFE was great, food was good and so was the cabin service. The airline though sent a 777 with the old cabin from Bengaluru to Dubai, which was not so bad, but made me a bit disappointed. The next flight from Dubai to Washington DC also was served by a Boeing 777, but with the latest cabin with a new, big, modern IFE screen and a brighter cabin, which made a difference for the better. Apart from the old cabin, I found the legroom to be quite a bit lesser than what I initially thought. Perhaps I should try the Airbus A380 if I am to get a better experience. But the 777s were also equally nice, at least in Economy. Since I was flying during Covid time, I was also a tad bit disappointed over no hot towels and menu cards in Economy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this airline.', 'I had an exceptional flight, the staff were considerate and polite. Cabin staff Aaliyah was kind and generous and showed thoughtfulness. I will definitely continue to travel with Emirates again', 'I purchased 3 round trip tickets for my family members back in November 2022 to fly in March 2023 for approximately $2300, while I was booking I didnât notice that tickets are non-refundable. With in a first hour after booking I decided to cancel tickets, I called the Emirates customer service and explained the situation I asked if itâs possible to cancel, they said âsure you canâ , will refund you the money with in 21 business days. They canceled my tickets and never did the refund. I called they many times after asked for the money they said my tickets not refundable. They should not have cancel them then, they gave me wrong information. Would not recommend to deal with company like that.', 'Check in at Manchester airport was fine, take off time was delayed by 40 minutes as it arrived 20 minutes late. The service has gone downhill since i last flown with them. There was no drinks services or menu cards, it was not a full flight so had the whole row of seats to myself which i utilised as a bed. The A380-800 is a great plane to fly, plenty of seat and leg room and alo very quiet. The 2nd journey was completely different, the Boeing 777-300er was old, very narrow with limited leg room, the engines were loud,t he comment âcattle classâ comes to mind, there was a vietnamese couple sat next to me, the crew thought i was with them and handed me the same meal & drinks as them, luckily i wanted the same meal as them, she then realised that we were not together when i spoke and asked for a different drink. The crew seemed to lack interest. I would fly with them again but only because of their competitive price', \"I would not have bought the Emirates tickets if I knew I was flying with Qantas. Poor seats and inflight entertainment sucks (Headset point is broken). 4hrs of boredom and food is below average. Airline staff cannot figure out fix the problem or have my seats changed. Waste of money! 800NZD for round ticket AKL to MEL. Done with Emirates and Qantas (I didn't even choose Qantas). Will stick with my fav airlines Qatar and AirNZ!\", 'Worst traveling experience in last 20 years of business and leisure traveling. They tried to force me to give my hand carry bag to luggage. To do so, they wasted my time, asked me to stand on the side and made me go and talk to lot of different people. They argue that I can not have hand carry bag and laptop bag separately. To make the situation worst another ground staff at the time of entering plane stopped me and pressurized me to board the plane with just laptop bag (which anyway going to be in my legroom).  On many occasions, I paid extra and chose Emirates for the service and comfort which seems to be a thing of a past. From now on I will never choose Emirates if I have an option.', 'This was a nightmare and the most horrible airline Iâve ever taken in my life. Unfriendly staff. Customer care is zero. Whatever I asked for wasnât done. I needed my seat switched so the crew told me to go look for a seat. Passengers were pretty annoyed of me asking around when she shouldâve done that herself to avoid this. Asked for couple things itâs either not available like (tissues) or a mask? Food is terrible. Flight was late so now I will be missing my connection.', \"On the Emirates return flight from Kolkata there was no option to pay for extra baggage during online check in even though the Emirates website mentions that passengers should be paying for extra baggage during check in to save money. The option to do so was greyed out and unavailable. I ended up paying the equivalent to $270.00 CAD for 1 extra luggage at the Emirates counter at the airport during baggage drop off. I called Emirates to complain and the customer service said itâs because it is a connecting flight from Kolkata and that option is not available. It shouldn't matter because i paid only $100 CAD during the Air Canada check in to Dubai for a stop over on the way to Kolkata. On top of that Emirates didn't update me by email or text messages after online check in. I think Emirates has really bad customer service and I will never fly with this airline again.\", 'Ground staff are very unfriendly and not helpful, making my trip unpleasant to start up with. The waiting line is also quite unorganized with no supporting staffs maintaining order. Nonetheless, I was able to check in my luggages and headed to the boarding gate with no big problems. Seating comfort on the economy class in B777 and food quality are above average. The entertainment screen works fine. No delays on departure. I may not want to fly Emirates in the future.', \"Overrated airline. This was my first flight with Emirates after having heard so much hype about it for many years now. Previously I have flown with Qatar airways on the same route. Cons: Terrible seating, very cramped and narrow, not enough space to even move feet. Very little quantity of food - hardly 2-3 spoons of 3 items each, plus bun and butter. Water/drinks served only twice in 6.5 hour flight. No response despite pressing button for assistance. In-flight entertainment sucks. My seat's screen had touchscreen that did not work. Overpriced tickets. Too much walking in Dubai, no buggy service.\", 'In December 2022 I travelled from Sydney to Dubai with Emirates First Class. I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful. Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year. Totally not worth the money or air miles.', \"I was quite disappointed given how much I paid for the ticket. I had a business trip in Hong Kong and I returned from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The airport was huge but the Emirates ground service was very poor. There was some issues at the check in counter causing me to wait at least half hour for my turn to check in luggage. The seats at the economy class is good, on par with other airlines. The cabin crews are nice and helpful and it seems the cabin crew are all coming from different countries but I don't any Emirati or Middle Eastern cabin crew. I wish there are more Asian food options (I'm Thai) on food instead of Middle Eastern/Arabic food. The inflight entertainment was okay, nothing surprising. With the whole flight experience, I think it is not value for money. Will take other airlines next time instead.\", \"Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days). To get on that flight from Bahrain to London I have to pay a 200GBP 'change fee' and the difference in fare - for a flight that I have already paid for, and that I would have made.\", \"This is, by far, the best flight I have ever been on! I would give this way more than 10/10 if I could! Food: Meals, drinks, and snacks were absolutely delicious, especially the pizza, turkey sandwich, and more! Seating: We were in the aisle row (no windows, but it was still cool, because I had tons of legroom.) I loved how the seat and headrest reclined and how the tray was so big. Staff: Don't get me started! They were amazing. They attended to all our needs. Hot water? They got you. Lost headphones? They got you. Never seen a nicer staff. Entertainment: Did not exactly broaden to all my interests, but headphones were fully immersive. Amnesties: Oh my god, there's so many! Reclining seat. Bathroom lotion. Goodies bag with toothbrushing tools. The list is endless!\", 'This was the worst flight I have ever had. Poor customer service from start to end. I flew with Emirates from Gatwick to Dubai with my partner and 5 children. My 4 year old son is Autistic. Their level of service on board is awful, food was below standards. I kept on pressing the assistant bell and no one came over to assist me. I was only served drinks twice on a 7 hour flight. Toilets on board were disgusting. Seats are uncomfortable. I was expecting more from Emirates especially when travelling with a child with a disability. You have better service on British Airways and they are not even that great.', 'After arriving at Chicago I had to wait for 4-5 hours for my baggage and missed my Amtrak train ticket even after 4 hours gap. They were sending baggage in groups few people got it in an hour and few of us got were standing for 5 hours.', 'I would like to say thank you to the cabin crew on flight EK 213 from Dubai-Miami on 01/29/23 for their professional management of a violent person inside the aircraft, despite the delay it brought as a consequence of this unacceptable behavior they followed the protocol for this kind of situation.', \"After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance. I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines. If you need wheelchair assistance at Dubai Airport, do not fly with Emirates.\", 'Had a very good experience with Emirates. Crew was very enthusiastic and attentive and the food delicious- how often do you eat everything served on a flight? Mediocre service on the ground though, a 20 min bus ride from the plane in DXB, long wait for baggage in CPH and no bag tag available at self service in DXB. Would still highly recommend EK.', 'I landed in Dubai on the 27th Jan in transit to Perth, with a 19hrs layover. When I inquired about accommodation I was told by Emirates staff that they could not help because I did not book it in advance. At no point during the booking I was notified I needed to request accommodation in advance. I had to spend 19 hours at the airport because I did not have any cash to book a hotel at my expense. Will definitely think twice before flying Emirates again.', 'The airline was very good. The boarding experience was good. The flight was on time. There was a blanket, a pillow and a headrest on the seat. The seat was comfortable and cabin crew was  helpful and polite. The service was also very good, and the food tasted amazing. The in flight entertainment is the best  and you will never get bored. Overall I think this is a very good airline and definitely worth flying with. I will fly Emirates again.', 'We traveled with a group of 5, going to Karachi via Dubai was great as we were able to pay to upgrade to business class. On the return flight we were not able to pay for the upgrade option as there was no availability. From the check in counter at the Karachi airport to the transfer of the wheel chair passenger (with me) to the flight back to Houston the experience was horrible. The person working at the emirates counter in Karachi asking for a indirect bribe to the incompetent staff at the Dubai airport making us wait like a hour for wheel chair staff to transport us to the lounge as we waited for the connecting flight. When I asked to make sure we the wheel chair passengers are taken to the plaza lounge he asked how I had access I stated through Amex Business platinum. It was non of his business as an Emirates employee to ask to see my card for a lounge. The service on the plane was horrible. Full of very overworked and tired flight staff that looked worn out and unhappy. Not sure I will fly with Emirates after this.', 'Emirates used to be a good airline once upon a time. The airline quality, attitude of staff and service is absolutely horrible. The boarding process and the attitude of staff during boarding is very arrogant. They have no concept of service. The aircraft is clean but not as clean as it used to be. I saw stained seats.  The cabin crew are very young and inexperienced. When the aircraft had barely touched down and passengers were off their seats and the cabin crew did nothing. The approx wait time for bag arrival is about one hour.', 'I am astonished to read the number of negative reviews this airline receives. I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork. Maybe its the luck of the draw, but I personally think Emirates is tops.', 'We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew. Absolutely appalling customer service. Every customer should think twice about using Emirates unless they are happy to be treated very unfairly when something does wrong.', \"This complaint regarding Baggage Services. I fly from Dhaka, Bangladesh to New York and connection was in Dubai. When I landed in NY one of my luggage was missing and they told me that it was last traced in Dubai. Today, it's been 7 days and when I call customer service they are keep telling me that they couldn't find the baggage, they are looking into all the airports which sound very stupid. Everyday when I call them they are keep telling me that they are escalating to higher authority. Also they are ensuring me that I will receive a call back in 24 hours which never happened in last 7 days. I am very annoyed right now don't know what should I do.\", 'My partner and I requested wheelchair and assistance. He has his own electric wheelchair. I have been in front of the business class counter where we asked if they had a priority line and solicited the wheelchair and asked where to go. We got a few contradictory answers (and many employeesâ nasty looks) and, after sitting on the luggage and floor por 40 minutes, because the request of a young couple that felt bad about my situation, the left a wheelchair at my side and no assistance. I am afraid of losing the flight and am still being ignored after about an hour and 15 min.  This company doesnât have the most basic respect for the passengers! Economy class passengers are human beings too. I try to avoid wheelchairs but airports and the long walking distances with all the luggage are a challenge. They do not even start to check in economy before all business passengers are gone. They donât even pretend to care! I donât know if I am going to a developed country anymore. The introduction is not good. When I finally got assistance, the lady helping me was extremely nice (Mariluz). Value for money - a waste of money Ground service below horrifying.', 'Incredibly poor experience for such an incredibly expensive flight. We flew from Milan to New York with a connection to Atlanta. We were held on the tarmac for almost an hour and a half with no explanation. Not surprisingly, we missed our flight. I went to the counter to get rebooked to a new one. It took 2 hours for the (extremely rude) customer service representative to offer me a flight 24 hours later and a motel (1/5 star review on Google). They insisted nothing else was available even though we were seeing tons of availability on our own. Furthermore, they told us we would get reimbursed for ubers and food during the 24 hours. I contacted Emirates several times and have had no such luck in getting reimbursed. They completely ignore you. Will never fly Emirates again despite the name brand.', 'I canât believe Iâm writing this about Emirates since Iâve been flying with them for years but their customer service has gone down dramatically! I donât know if itâs because they donât pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardessâs are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They donât want to do any hard work. Canât even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely donât get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I donât know if they changed the catering? Total waste of my money and time. I should have flown Qatar Airways where you get your own cabin (with sliding door for privacy) and the air hostess are super kind and friendly. Only for $300 itâs totally worth it. Learned my lesson! Never again Emirates!', 'My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn\\'t smile, weren\\'t friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me \"this way, please,\" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn\\'t offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it\\'s not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn\\'t be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times! I will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices. However, i do hope to see friendlier faces in future.', 'My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didnât order it, Then why was it an option and it didnât have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didnât eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasnât warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight. They say Emirates is a number 1 airline in the world and flying them is almost a privilege, but I disagree, Sorry.', 'Though Emirates only operates a handful of flights to and from Milan, it maintains a nice, spacious lounge with ample seating and good selections of food. I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent. However, I did encounter one of the nicest attendants in the sky.', 'Do not trust them. Worst Airline and customer service. Purchased the ticket in full. Was issued E-ticket via email. Arrived to destination. On the return leg flight, was refused check in. Printed and presented at the check in. Upon presenting, the passenger was advised that the ticket is not valid and the seat that was booked in not available. Advised to purchase another ticket. When told that the ticket was all paid for and e-ticket was presented, they advised that they canât do anything and advised to contact customer care. The check in closed and the flight departed. No money was returned. After contacting the customer service, advised to lodge an investigation. When asked what to do for the time being, they advised to purchase another ticket and deal with complaints department. Another ticket was purchased. Both customer service team and complaints department advised that they cannot do anything and to deal with the bank. When challenged the decisions, the both departments simply engorged communication. Ended up being double the money out of pocket and no explanation. Would never fly again with this shade company and will advise everyone to avoid as this can happen to anyone. Because the head office is overseas, no local governing agency have any power to challenge them. Be careful and stay away.', \"First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that âit wasn't their faultâ. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok. (Drinks actually very nice), crew was a mix of friendly, hard-working people and some who couldnât care less.\", 'This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to âno spaceâ on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and whatâs worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I donât remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. Iâm not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didnât seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and thatâs how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out.', 'I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate \\'fare differences\\'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your \\'fare type\\' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you\\'re on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you\\'re lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of Â£100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a \\'fare difference\\' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or \"officer\")', 'Reserved Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Dhaka via Dubai. Booked economy Seat From LGW/DXB -Paid Upper Deck Seat . Dubai Dhaka Business Class. Reported at check in desk on time. Double check with counter that, when will get Wheelchair. The lady from counter replied that, not possible to provide wheelchair as my seat is in upper deck. I asked her if any complications for wheelchair just arrange to drop me in boarding Gate. She told me not possible at all. If I will move my seat from upper deck to main deck then only possible. I asked her why. She told me we Emirates donât provide wheelchair service in upper deck. I asked her what will happen, the passengers who needs wheelchair assistance & traveling in business class obviously seats in upper deck. She didnât respond. We can not provide wheelchair assistance in upper deck. I told her no need upper deck as I need until the boarding Room. She refused me. Very worst service ever in my life. Avoid Emirates, who need special Assistance I mean wheelchair.', 'I always travel by Emirates and liked it but this was my first time traveling with my 14 months old baby. The seat I got was too small to fit us both. I didnât know I have to carry my baby even when heâs asleep. I asked for bassinet and they said if babyâs legs are not straight while lying in bassinet then itâs not for the baby. I had to carry him throughout the flight because he was mostly asleep. When they provided me meal I couldnât open my table as while holding baby table couldnât be opened. I barely ate a little and gave up. Meal for baby was also not provided although it was included in the ticket. It was a huge disappointment. I couldnât use inflight entertainment either for baby because there was no room.', 'I got a last minute upgrade offer and went for it without contemplation. The business class seats on the Boeing 777 were comfortable and I managed to get a very good sleep. The service was excellent and I felt really spoiled and taken care of. The meals were also good starting with the beef and rice dinner and ending with a delicious omelette breakfast. I remember the Emirates infotainment âICEâ had more variety before but I was still kept well occupied.', 'The flight departed a little late. Boarding was organised. Had Aisle seat 84C which chose and paid for At booking. Gluten Free meal served early and cabin crew checked name and request for Gluten free. Best Gluten Free meals on any airline. The cabin crew on this flight worked nonstop. Water and soft drinks between meals which was good. One cabin crew stood out on this flight she was constantly attending passengers needs and had a bright energetic personality. My husband and i arrived slightly late into Brisbane but safely. First flight of 14 hours which i never felt jet lagged and flown this flight many times put it down to only drinking water with meals whole flight.', 'Venice to Dubai 12 November. Check in very good at Marco Polo Airport. Some one in Emirates uniform directing passengers. At check in the staff not wearing Emirates uniform but excellent customer service and said she would check if once we arrived in Australia she could give us boarding pass for our Qantas connection in Brisbane for final destination but was not able. Later at boarding gate called over and received Boarding pass for final onward journey. The flight to Dubai was good, Allocated twin seats which booked and paid for and Excellent Gluten free meal served early. Cabin crew came around with water and soft drinks between meals and we arrived safely in Dubai for onward connection to Brisbane.', 'Absolutely awful service both inbound and outbound traveling with an infant. Emirates made a mistake on my booking with an infant which resulted in me having to spend 2 hours at in the airport running between check in desk and ticketing desk with a hungry crying infant to rectify the mistake Emirates created. Onboard the return flight, the flight attendant refused to provide bottled water for so I could prepare infant formula despite having charged me 10% ticket price as infant fare. Finally, on arrival we found our stroller damaged and the baggage team is proposing to offer is 500 AED which is insufficient to replace the stroller. Absolutely awful experience. I urge travelers with infants to choose a better airline.', 'Overall business class is quite good with friendly and polite flight staff. Few cons: seats are quite narrow. I\\'m 5\\'4\", 125 pounds and my elbows were hitting either side. You can lay on your back quite comfortably but I don\\'t know how a bigger person will be comfortable especially on long haul flights. In each of the 4 legs at every meal time, the flight attendant asked me \" do you want to eat dinner/ lunch/ brunch?\". Of course I would. Where would I go for sustenance on a 15 hour flight? It\\'s not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn\\'t really a vegan meal. For a $5k ticket, I\\'d have hoped Emirates would\\'ve been a little creative and thoughtful with the vegan meal.', \"Emirates, together with its agents, is engaged in deception and fraud in the exchange of tickets. I couldn't change my flight tickets for 2.5 weeks! They changed me a few hours before departure and took a fine of 200 euros. If you want to ruin your trip and vacation, contact Emirates, they will do it professionally!\", 'Superb airline. I really can not fault the airline at all. The cabin crew are extremely attentive, polite and friendly. The food was very tasty. In flight entertainment was very extensive for two 6 hours flights.', 'When travelling from Dubai to Srilanka and  from Srilanka to Dubai with Emirates and from London to Dubai and  Dubai to London is travelling with 2 different Airlines. Aircraft, the service, food is 1st class when travelling from Europe but  completely different services when travelling to Srilanka. I am requesting Emirates hierarchies to review this and treat every passenger the same. Honestly I thought I was travelling with EASYJET when I travelled from Srilanka to Dubai.', \"Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai. The service on board was great. The touchscreen of the board entertainment system is on some planes are better than on others. The movie collection was vast but didn't fit my taste. My seat wasn't locked. So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern. They count the overweight as total. If family members check in individually, they could save a few bucks.\", 'EK135 22 October Seat 46A. This flight was a continuation of the Brisbane to Dubai flight 24 hours later. The flight was not full but paid and was given twin seats for myself and wife. Worth the extra cost as 3 rows of seats behind reserved for cabin crew who never used them on this flight. Took off on time arrived on time 2 meals served on flight and usual water and soft drinks tea and coffee. A good flight.', 'Brisbane to Dubai. Paid for seat selection and was given correct seat aisle 84c was fortunate there was empty middle seat on 14 hour flight. The Gluten Free meals which Emirates serve are excellent. The flight went smoothly and landed safely. Perhaps the only negative was water given with 2 meals and snack no cabin crew coming around with extra water between you seem to have to ask. Then stayed overnight at Dubai Airport Hotel before onward journey to Venice.', \"The service I expected from a low cost carrier, not one of the supposedly best airlines in the world. One of the check in ladies at Copenhagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure.\", 'A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2. The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didnât serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didnât exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasnât impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle. All in all I think I would try another airline for this long journey next time, just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above.', 'Comfortable, clean, efficient, always goes above and beyond to make you feel pampered. Even in economy the seats are decently sized for a nap and staff are always ready to help.', 'Right from the airport I was facing an unpleasant experience. I was having a laptop bag and one hand baggage. The hand baggage was weighing exactly 7kg but he forced me to put both together and then put my baggage (there was no lock for it) into checked-in and had to pay for additional baggage. Then, while paying for it, they took my card and entered the card number when the payment is already done and machine has already generated receipt. Seems suspicious that my card number is needed to generate a receipt to my email for the additional baggage? Now money is gone and the baggage is damaged. The flight experience was not something great. Landing in Dubai had to wait forever for my baggage.', 'Dubai to New York. I misspelled a letter while booking my ticket, found out in the email I received, called to correct a letter, they charged me $30. Bad practice / regulation Emirates Airline. Will avoid in further booking.', \"Bangkok to Johannesburg via Dubai. This must have been the worst booking experience and customer service of my life. My partner and I booked the exact same route at the exact same time from 2 different laptops directly from the Emirates website. Emirates confirmed they received his payment, the money was out of his account, but part of his flight is not yet confirmed. After a couple of attempts, they made some adjustments and sorted out the issue a few hours later. My booking could not process payment due to a pricing problem between the airlines. After numerous failed attempts over 3 days via customer service and live chats, failed rebooking attempts for the same route, and empty promises from customer agents calling me back, I finally just booked another date to ensure that we can at least spend Christmas together. NEVER in my life have I experienced any issues like this with Qatar (or any other airlines for that matter). Emirates advertise routes and when it comes to booking, they're not able to process and if they do process, they do a half-ass job which leaves customers feeling stressed and running around trying to finalize flight details. Avoid avoid avoid is all I can say. There is a reason Qatar airways is 5 star, and Emirates is 4 star.\", 'Very impolite and rude cabin crew from ticketing counter to inside the plane. No just they donât want help but also ignore you. And you try to catch the attention they literally yell and pass sarcastic comments. I was traveling with my 1 year old. They made our flight a horrible experience and on purpose they did not offer baby food in a 7 hour flight. All crew looked unhappy and were unpleasant to talk with mostly female crews. My flight from Dubai to Algeria was a nightmare because of crew negative behavior and lack of empathy for a mother whoâs was traveling with a 1 year old.', 'It wasnât a good experience at all. Young newly married couple who were clearly already pretty tipsy on boarding starting boozing hard as soon as it took off and kept a steady pace of drinking solidly for the entire 8hr flight. Cabin attendants kept giving them can after can even though they were getting very drunk. No consideration for others seated anywhere near them and it was really quite uncomfortable given the volume of their constant loud drunken chatter. After we landed at Dubai as I was standing in the aisle waiting on someone lifting something down from the overhead bins the male passenger staggered to his feet wobbled towards me and aggressively barked âwhere do you think youâre going eh?â Thankfully he was drunk enough I could sidestep him and leave him swaying around but come on Emirates youâre better than this. The cabin attendants should have stopped serving this pair long before landing as they were clearly intoxicated. Not good at all.', 'The first time travelling Emirates Business class and the last. They lost my luggage in Dubai and have now been without it for nearly 3 weeks. They have not contacted me once. I have phoned 3 times and have been promised $50 per day compensation, money back for all the clothes I have had to buy and calls back to advise on the progress of tracing my lost luggage. When I ask about how I claim this compensation they refuse to answer. They also refuse to answer timelines for tracing my luggage. They have been utterly useless and disinterested. I have called them, used Twitter and Facebook and they have delivered only generic responses. I have lodged two complaints through their complaints portal. No response. Please pick another airline.', 'Firstly, canceled flights departing Athens to Perth leaving us stranded in Athens for a night so we had to get accomodation. Then you had my booked with a 14 hour stop over in Dubai which is unacceptable. I requested this to be changed and it was to a later flight which worked better. I was reassured my partners flight had been linked (we had separate bookings) and that we were both on the new flight together (this was via virtual chat). We arrive at the airport to check in and even though he had received flight confirmation we were told he didnât have tickets so we had to go get this sorted at the emirates desk. Weâre both finally on the same flight only to be told we cannot be seated together on either of the flights even though we booked months ago and had already selected our seats together. The man at Athens airport checking us in did not care or try to assist us. Absolutely terrible experience and now my partner and I get to sit alone on an 11 hour flight. Completely unacceptable and very poor form from Emirates. I want a refund or some form of compensation for the hotel, meals in Athens whilst stranded and the stress of this whole situation. Completely ruined the end of our trip. I will never fly with them again.', 'We arrived in good time to check in at Dubai only to find that my wifeâs and 5 year old daughters seats had been changed to be apart on the flight. Previously we had been sent an automatic allocation of seats 2 days before the flight placing them together. Despite my pointing out that a 5 year old cannot travel unaccompanied, no one seemed to care and I had to insist that a manager at least be involved. We were then taken to the aircraft in the hope that some passengers might change seats. 20 minutes past with no good news whilst we were just left to stand by the aircraft door. At no point was any offer made regarding accommodation or alternate flight and, again, we were encouraged to accept that our daughter would have to travel next to a random stranger and presumably feed herself hot meals throughout the 7 hour flight. And then as the doors were about to be shut 2 seats together were suddenly found! When I complained formally about the distress this all caused, a curt reply was sent denying that seats had been changed at check in. My view of this airline feels irreparable damaged and I simply wouldnât trust them with providing a reliable and safe journey in the future when they cannot even look properly at what went wrong on this occasion.', \"Outbound (BAH TO DXB): Smooth flight, generous amount of food for such a short flight and it was tasty as well Outbound (DXB to BHX): Disastrous, flight was overbooked and cramped making the staff take a long time to board, we economy passengers were basically treated like cattle. IFE wasn't responsive, and food especially breakfast were bad - portions fit for a child, and mid flight I realized the meals had given me stomach pains and nausea. Inbound (BHX to DXB): Extremely bad service, 3 hours after take off and nothing (not even drinks) were given, my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally, it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals (including my seat mate). Besides that, my meal was terrible barely cooked pasta with a droplet of sauce, dead vegetables that was pathetically called a salad, and I was given a bread roll with nothing to use it with. Crew barely served any drinks, I got massively dehydrated (7hrs flight), and in the morning they refused to serve me breakfast because I woke up 2 hours before landing - not even a coffee or tea was offered to me. Overall, it's was a very below average flight and Emirates is overhyped for nothing.\", 'The flight in which i travelled from Dubai to Amsterdam turned out to be the worst experience by Emirates. Water was dripping from the roof and the crew took it very lightly. They were responding that we have informed to our manager, but no actions were taken about it till i landed in Amsterdam. I literally had to hold and sit with the plastic cover they had given as the blanket cover for most of the distance.', 'I had booked return flights with wheelchair service for my 60 year old Mom for AMD to DFW and back. The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my motherâs health and age.  While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesnât have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed? Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but âHer wheelchair is bookedâ. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airport from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was âOur staff will be there to assist her everywhereâ. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with nobody to help. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter. I genuinely liked Emirates but this is very disappointing and inconvenient especially given that mother is a senior citizen. Iâll never fly emirates again.', \"Having purchased first class tickets for my wife and I to return to New Zealand in January we were very much looking forward to our return journey having booked business class on the outbound flights from New Zealand. The booking was made and fully paid for four months ago. I have been advised by curt email that I have been downgraded to business class, no mention of apology, explanation nor compensation or refund. It gets better, there seems no way of contacting Emirates in New Zealand their advertised phone number is cut off. What a shambles of an airline and we haven't even left the ground. This is how they treat premium paying clients, forget it. Book with another airline, never again!\", 'My first experience of Emirates new premium economy class. Food and service excellent. Seats however are a little bit firm and not as comfortable as the pictures suggest. Also the recline is quite big so you can feel a little trapped once the person in front refines. Access to three toilets for 50 plus passengers is a real bonus and you get glimpses of the flight deck if that is an interest. I paid very little in cost difference which was the attraction but Emirates economy is very good in any case so May not always be a choice I am willing to pay much extra for. Also it was a two meal service for a seven hour flight which is good.', 'My sister flew from Houston to Tehran via Dubai. In Houston, she paid $225 for an extra suitcase. The agent asked for cash and said they do not accept credit card but after my sister insisting that she does not have cash, they accepted her credit card.  Upon her arrival to Dubai for her second leg of her flight, she was asked to pay over $300 again. When she showed her receipt and the destination noted, the agent started to scream at her and say, either she pays or she will lose her flight. When she tried to reason, the man started to scream more and louder, and took her passport. My sister told him that she will pay, just tell her how to do it. Then the agent took her to a counter and when she went to pay, the price was increased to $350. She paid with credit card and they wanted the pin to her credit card. She told them the she did not have the PIN as this was not debit.  She decided to pay in cash, so she can leave but the agent got on her face. She was handed a repeat for $285 and she did not get her change back out of $400.  Now, I am scrambling in Houston to find a return flight for her, so she does not have to return to Dubai and moreover, to travel with Emirate.', 'When I fly from Jakarta to Zurich transit Dubai on 19 august the cabin crew was unpolite, Isit in the middle between my husband and my daughter, they ask my husband and my daughter for dinner but did not ask me so I call the bell for dinner and told that I am running out of food choices. Very disappointing.', 'Wish I had read these reviews. I paid over Â£2,500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. Iâm travelling with my wife and 2 babies (1 &2.5 years old). The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours, they suddenly decided to change my original flights, booked only 10 days before, theyâve sent me a text and a short email to say: this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he canât help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we canât answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers. Not only are we devastated but also out of pocket by Â£2,500 because we canât possibly go on their imposed alternative flight of 21.5 hours with 2 small restless babies.', 'We chose to book a more expensive flight due to shorter transit time in Dubai. However, just a few weeks before our flight, Emirates, without giving us any options, just changed our flight date and a much longer transit time in Dubai, no offer for a hotel overnight stay.
